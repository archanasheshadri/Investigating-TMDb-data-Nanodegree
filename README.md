# Investigating-TMDb-data-Nanodegree

This is a project which was submitted as part of Udacity Nanodegree program.

I have considered the TMDb(The Movie Database) data to perform data analysis. This dataset consists of information about more than 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb).

Mainly I have used NumPy, Pandas, seaborn, and Matplotlib to complete this project. 

This project invovles:
* All the steps invovled in a typical data analysis process
* Posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* Investigating problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
* Using vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up the data analysis code
* Using pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access the data more conveniently
* Using Matplotlib to produce plots showing the findings
